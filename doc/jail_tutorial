Determine partitioning layout. You will need the following paritions.
# Master partition
# A partition to hold jail archive files
# Two or more slave partitions
# A partition (normally the master partition) for the boot loader 

Install OS on master parition. Also create parition to hold jail files and for swap.


Configure the master OS as follows.
# install rcqatools
# create directories /jails/bootable, /mnt/slave1, /mnt/slave2, etc.
# In /etc/fstab set Jail partition to mount to /jails
# In /etc/fstab set slave partions to mount to /mnt/slave1, /mnt/slave2, etc.
# Add entries for each slave partition to /boot/grub/menu.1st 

Install OS on slave partition, during the install do not install a boot loader. Also do NOT install the OS to multiple partitions.

Configure the slave OS as follows.
# Create directories /mnt/master, /jails and /mnt/slave[X]. 
# Replace the /etc/fstab file with a copy of the fstab file from the master partition. 
# On slave parition edit the /etc/fstab so that the newly-installed partion mounts to / and the master partition mounts to /mnt/master.
# Confirm that the symlinks (in /boot) for vmlinuz and initrd exist and point to the correct files.
# Check for any directories like /data1, /data2, etc., confirm that they are empty and delete them.
# Perform any other customization you want in the jail

Reboot the machine to the master partition.

Change to the directory where the partition with new slave OS is mounted (/mnt/slave6, for example).

Pick a name for the jail that includes the OS, platform, and any non-default settings you used when creating it. (suse-93-x86_64-sp1-gnome, for example)

Run the command: GZIP="--best" tar cfz /jails/bootable/<jail_name>.tar.gz *

Test the jail

# Using the rcqa scripts, deploy the new jail to a different partition, 
# boot to that partition 
# make sure you can log in to the machine with the root password. Test that /mnt/master and /jails are correctly mounted. From a remote computer, make sure you can log in with ssh. Confirm that the qa-master script exists.
